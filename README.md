# **SENTIMENT ANALYSIS**
**a. To Do :** 
Build a Text Classification Model for Sentiment Analysis \
**b. Description :**  You are required to build a text classification model for sentiment 
analysis using a dataset of online product reviews. \
**c. Requirements :** \
i. Load the dataset and preprocess it if necessary (handle missing values,
scale features, etc).\
ii. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.\
iii. Implement a simple linear regression model using libraries like scikit-learn
or TensorFlow.\
iv. Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the
testing set using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error,
R-squared).\
v. Visualize the regression line along with the actual data points using
matplotlib or any other suitable visualization library.
